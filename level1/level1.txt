Fossil records of crayfish older than 30 million years are rare, but fossilised burrows have been found from strata as old as the late Palaeozoic or early Mesozoic.[29][30] The oldest records of the Parastacidae are in Australia, and are 115 million years old[31] and the crayfish Mongolarachne chaoyangensis and Cricoidoscelosus aethus are at least 129.7 million years old, making them both one of, if not, the oldest known crayfish to date.[32]
